    "The goal of this project is to figure out which residential NYC neighborhoods experienced the biggest transitions from in-person to work-from-home employment post pandemic, in order to sell our client's patented lumbar support pillows in a more targeted way.\n",

    "To this end, I picked out a single representative June 2019 weekday from the publicly available MTA turnstile dataset.  This entry will serve as a baseline, representing typical pre-Covid commute patterns.  My hypothesis is that the net outflow of people at a station (number of entries minus number of exits) between the hours of 3am and 1pm will have a strong correlation with net number of residents commuting to their work site. \n",
